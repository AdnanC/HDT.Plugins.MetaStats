# HDT.Plugins.MetaStats


I started this project to help me and my friends stay on top of the current meta by trying to figure out what deck our opponent was playing. Since then though the plugin has evolved into something completely different. Now this plugin is used to get fun stats on meta state of Hearthstone. All the stats are published on http://metastats.net.
